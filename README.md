# Bookstore

> The main objective of this repo is to learn to use React and Redux to build a very simple application.<br />

Is a real-world project for a fictional company based in Germany.<br />
The company is called Magic-books Inc. and requested to build the front-end of an application that will help them organize and manage their bookstore.<br />

They want it to be fast, dynamic and responsive to their actions and therefore you decided to build it with React & Redux.<br />
